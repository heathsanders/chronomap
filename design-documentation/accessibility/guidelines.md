# ChronoMap Accessibility Guidelines

## Overview
ChronoMap is designed to be accessible to users of all abilities, ensuring that photo organization and memory exploration is available to everyone. Our accessibility approach goes beyond compliance to create genuinely inclusive experiences.

## Accessibility Principles

### 1. Privacy for All
Accessibility features must maintain ChronoMap's privacy-first approach. All accessibility improvements work locally without compromising user data.

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
Core photo organization functionality works with assistive technologies first, with enhanced features building upon this foundation.

### 3. User Control
Users can customize accessibility features to match their specific needs and preferences.

### 4. Contextual Information
Rich context about photos, locations, and time periods is available through multiple channels (visual, auditory, haptic).

## Visual Accessibility

### Color Contrast Standards

#### WCAG AA Compliance (Minimum)
- **Normal Text**: 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- **Large Text**: 3.1 contrast ratio minimum (18px+ or 14px+ bold)
- **Interactive Elements**: 3:1 contrast ratio for focus indicators and UI elements

#### Enhanced Standards (ChronoMap Specific)
- **Privacy Indicators**: 7:1 contrast ratio for trust-critical elements
- **Photo Context Information**: 4.5:1 minimum even with photo backgrounds
- **Error States**: Enhanced contrast for critical feedback

#### High Contrast Mode Support
- **Automatic Enhancement**: Detect system high contrast settings
- **Color Inversion**: Support for users who invert system colors
- **Border Addition**: Add visible borders to all interactive elements
- **Background Simplification**: Replace photo backgrounds with solid colors when needed

### Visual Impairment Support

#### Low Vision Accommodations
- **Scalable Interface**: Support iOS Dynamic Type and Android font scaling up to 200%
- **Zoom Compatibility**: Interface remains functional with system zoom up to 500%
- **Focus Indicators**: High-contrast 3px outlines for all interactive elements
- **Motion Reduction**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` system setting

#### Color Blindness Considerations
- **Color Independence**: No information conveyed through color alone
- **Pattern Alternatives**: Use icons, shapes, and text in addition to color coding
- **Deuteranopia Testing**: Verified compatibility with red-green color blindness
- **Protanopia Testing**: Verified compatibility with red-green color blindness (red-weak)
- **Tritanopia Testing**: Verified compatibility with blue-yellow color blindness

### Typography Accessibility

#### Readable Text Standards
- **Minimum Size**: 16px base font size for body text
- **Line Height**: 1.5 minimum for comfortable reading
- **Character Spacing**: Normal spacing, not condensed
- **Word Spacing**: Adequate spacing between words for dyslexic users

#### Dynamic Type Support
- **iOS Dynamic Type**: Full support for all accessibility text sizes
- **Android Font Scale**: Support up to 200% scaling
- **Layout Adaptation**: Interface reflows appropriately for larger text
- **Content Prioritization**: Most important content remains visible at largest sizes
