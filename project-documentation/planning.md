- **Performance Foundation**: Critical for Epic 3 success, impacts all subsequent epics
- **Database Schema**: Must be finalized in Epic 1, migrations planned for changes

## Technical Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Performance with Large Libraries**: 50,000+ photo requirement
   - *Mitigation*: Dedicated Epic 3 for performance optimization
   - *Fallback*: Implement library size limits for free tier

2. **iOS/Android Consistency**: Cross-platform behavior differences
   - *Mitigation*: Platform-specific testing in each epic
   - *Fallback*: Platform-specific implementations where necessary

3. **Privacy Compliance**: Zero external data transmission requirement
   - *Mitigation*: Privacy-first architecture from Epic 1
   - *Fallback*: Extensive privacy auditing and compliance verification

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Battery Usage**: Background processing impact
   - *Mitigation*: Smart background task management
   - *Fallback*: User-controlled processing options

2. **Storage Space**: Metadata and cache storage requirements
   - *Mitigation*: Efficient storage patterns and cleanup
   - *Fallback*: User-configurable cache limits
