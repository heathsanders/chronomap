## Feature Specifications

### Feature 1: Media Library Scanning
**User Story**: As a privacy-conscious user, I want the app to scan my photo library locally so that I can organize my photos without uploading them anywhere.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a user grants photo library permission, when the scan begins, then all photos/videos are indexed with metadata
- Given large photo libraries (10,000+ items), when scanning occurs, then progress is shown with estimated completion time
- Given the scan is interrupted, when the app restarts, then scanning resumes from the last checkpoint
- Edge case: Handle corrupted files gracefully without crashing

**Priority**: P0 (Critical for MVP)
**Dependencies**: iOS/Android photo library permissions
**Technical Constraints**: Must work offline, handle large datasets efficiently
**UX Considerations**: Clear progress indication, ability to use app while scanning

### Feature 2: Location & Date Metadata Extraction
**User Story**: As a travel enthusiast, I want my photos automatically organized by location and time so that I can explore my memories geographically and chronologically.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a photo with GPS metadata, when processed, then location is reverse-geocoded to human-readable address
- Given a photo without GPS data, when processed, then it's organized by date/time only
- Given photos from different time zones, when processed, then timestamps are normalized to local time
- Edge case: Handle photos with incorrect timestamps or missing metadata

**Priority**: P0 (Core feature)
**Dependencies**: Offline geocoding database, timezone handling
**Technical Constraints**: Must work without internet connection
**UX Considerations**: Clear indication when location data is missing

### Feature 3: Timeline Navigation
**User Story**: As a family documenter, I want to browse my photos on an interactive timeline so that I can easily find memories from specific time periods.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given organized photos, when viewing timeline, then photos are grouped by day/month/year
- Given a specific date selection, when tapped, then photos from that period are displayed
- Given timeline scrolling, when moving through time, then smooth performance is maintained
- Edge case: Handle date ranges with no photos gracefully

**Priority**: P0 (Core feature)
**Dependencies**: Date metadata extraction
**Technical Constraints**: Smooth scrolling with large datasets
**UX Considerations**: Intuitive time navigation, quick jumping to specific dates

### Feature 4: Interactive Map View
**User Story**: As a travel enthusiast, I want to see my photos plotted on an interactive map so that I can explore memories by geographic location.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given photos with location data, when viewing map, then photos are clustered by geographic proximity
- Given a map cluster selection, when tapped, then photos from that location are displayed
- Given map navigation, when zooming/panning, then clusters update responsively
- Edge case: Handle photos from same location taken at different times

**Priority**: P1 (Important for differentiation)
**Dependencies**: Location metadata, offline map tiles
**Technical Constraints**: Efficient clustering algorithms, offline map storage
**UX Considerations**: Clear clustering, easy zoom controls, location context

### Feature 5: Local Data Persistence
**User Story**: As a privacy-conscious user, I want all my photo organization data stored locally so that my personal information never leaves my device.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given photo metadata processing, when complete, then all data is stored in local database
- Given app restart, when opened, then previous organization is immediately available
- Given storage limitations, when reached, then user is notified with options
- Edge case: Handle database corruption with recovery mechanisms

**Priority**: P0 (Privacy requirement)
**Dependencies**: Local database implementation
**Technical Constraints**: Efficient local storage, data integrity
**UX Considerations**: Fast app startup, clear storage usage indication

### Feature 6: Multi-Select Media Management
**User Story**: As a user with many photos, I want to select and delete multiple photos at once so that I can efficiently manage my photo library.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given photo browsing mode, when multi-select is enabled, then photos can be selected with checkboxes
- Given selected photos, when delete is confirmed, then photos are permanently removed from device
- Given bulk operations, when in progress, then clear feedback is provided
- Edge case: Handle deletion failures gracefully with retry options

**Priority**: P1 (User convenience)
**Dependencies**: Photo library write permissions
**Technical Constraints**: Permanent deletion from device storage
**UX Considerations**: Clear selection feedback, confirmation dialogs for deletion
